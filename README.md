Some stuff for working with GDAL/OGR I like to keep handy



## setenv.bat

Adds `%cd%\bin` to path and reports available local bin scripts when initiated.

I use these by copying `setenv.bat` and `.\bin` to a project folder. After 
that a convenient 2x-click and I have command shell with local scripts 
ready to go.
